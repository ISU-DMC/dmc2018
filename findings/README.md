| [abhicc](https://github.com/abhicc) | Need to decide methods/techniques to predict date(and thus our target variable). One way could be waiting time approach. Predict the waiting time before unit(units) sell out. Need to decide how to combine info from all datasets and how to prepare train and test data. Think of ways to include effect of specific dates(days) and effect of 'February' month.  |
