|---|--------------------|
| [abhicc](https://github.com/abhicc) | Need to decide methods/techniques to predict date(and thus our target variable). One way could be waiting time approach. Predict the waiting time before unit(units) sell out. Need to decide how to combine info from all datasets and how to prepare train and test data. Think of ways to include effect of specific dates(days) and effect of 'February' month.  |
| [EugeneHao](https://github.com/EugeneHao) |`- Besides the Black Friday, the price in Jan and Feb,2018 had large change and the change was very frequent. In Feb, the price rose up at the beginning and then dropped a lot on 25th. Probabiliy Winter Olympic and anther festival on 27th Feb had large impact. Around Valentine's Day, price changed little. ` <br/>`- the price had downtrend and got its lowest on 25th Feb and then rose up. `<br/>`(Yuchen Wang's finding)And items in Maincategory 15 had large discount, items in Maincategory 9 had small discount. In mainCateroty 1, items in category 2 had small discount and items in category 7 had large discount.`  |
| [jiamingqiu](https://github.com/jiamingqiu) |`-I think LSTM RNN might work, I put an example code for text generation here.`[TextLSTM_charBychar.R](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/jiamingqiu/TextLSTM_charBychar.R) `-Though I have not tried this with our data, nor can I claim I know what I am doing.` <br/> `-Another interesting stuff: `[forcasting shampoo sale with LSTM network](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-long-short-term-memory-network-python/)<br/> `-Some comments if trying traditional method: Although I have not tried this, Poisson regression is not necessarily a bad idea, namely treat the number of sales per day per pidXsize as independent random variables, denoted as y(date, pidXsize), and its mean as lambda(date, pidXsize), link our covariates(date), say category, IsHoliday(date), discount(date)... to the mean, say lambda(date, pidXsize) = f(covariates(date, pidXsize)). One problem I can imagine doing this is you will end up tones of 0 response.`|

| [rksyouyou](https://github.com/rksyouyou) | `- Size count for each product. More than 40% of products have size count equal to 1. A new variable can be construct based on the size count of a product.`<br/> `- Some sizes are less informative and could be treated as the same category, e.g. “M(38/40)” and “M(38-42)”. Categories like this could be useful when combining with other features.` <br/> - [shoe size web](https://www.healthyfeetstore.com/shoe-length-sizing-charts.html)<br/> - [European sizes](https://www.blitzresults.com/en/european-sizes/). <br/> `- Recode size featrue and provide four new variables related to size, each has 75, 44, 28, 14 categories [size_codebook.txt](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/rksyouyou/size_clean/size_codebook.txt). An explanation of these variable is saved in [size_codebook.pdf](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/rksyouyou/size_clean/size_codebook.pdf). |
| [ShanYu3393](https://github.com/ShanYu3393) | Notice: there are 7616 (pid size) only having one stock. Negative correlation between daily sale and daily price. |

| [yudizhangzyd](https://github.com/yudizhangzyd) | Maincategory 15 doesn't have subcategory, only category 37 belongs to both maincategory 1 and 9, the rest categories all belong to one maincategory. |

| [XiaodanLyu](https://github.com/XiaodanLyu) |`- Around 15% of the 12824 products (which I'll call new products) are released after 2017-10-01.`<br/>`- I agree with Yuchen's findings about the intepretation of the categories and subCategories.`[link](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/yuchenw2015/Sub%20Category.pdf)<br/>`- Most of the clothes and shoes only have one stock; most of the accessories have more than one stock.`[pic](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/XiaodanLyu/README.md#stock-on-feb-1st)<br/>`- In terms of sale volumes, clothes > accessories > shoes; for clothes: main Category 15 > 1 > 9; for shoes: main Category 1 ~= 9, adults > kids.`[pic](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/XiaodanLyu/README.md#sale-volumes)<br/>`- For old products, shoes of mainCategory 1 are seldom on sale, but shoes of mainCategory 9 are; clothes of mainCategory 9 are seldom on sale, but clothes of mainCategory 1 and 15 are.`<br/>`- All the new products have discount everyday. Similar pattern found for some of the homogeneous categories.`[pic](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/XiaodanLyu/README.md#discount)<br/>`- Brand, rrp, category (main/sub), releaseDate, even color are determined by pid, regardless of sizes.`<br/>`- ALL prices lower than rrp. Over 85% of the products have constant prices all the time.`<br/>`- ONLY the new products may have changing prices, usually increased at least once.`<br/>`- We decide to use obs from Oct-Dec as training data and Jan as test data. Only 7409 items sold both before and in January are considered. The stock on 2018-01-01 for each item in the training dataset is chosen by randomly drawing a number from 1 to the sale volumes in Jan with equal probability. We would like to compare different predictors with random guess, in which case all items are predicted to be sold out on the middle day of January, 2018-01-16. Everyone is welcome to try your idea on the split data and show your training error. For the sake of comparison, we had better use the same number of stock on 2018-01-01.`<br/>`- `[split-code](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/XiaodanLyu/data_split.md)<br/>` - `[split-data](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/tree/master/users/XiaodanLyu/data_clean)|
