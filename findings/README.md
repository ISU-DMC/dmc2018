| [abhicc](https://github.com/abhicc) | Need to decide methods/techniques to predict date(and thus our target variable). One way could be waiting time approach. Predict the waiting time before unit(units) sell out. Need to decide how to combine info from all datasets and how to prepare train and test data. Think of ways to include effect of specific dates(days) and effect of 'February' month.  |

| [XiaodanLyu](https://github.com/XiaodanLyu) |`- Nike and Adidas are the most popular brands. Adidas released more products after 2017-10-01 than Nike.`<br/>`- Brand, rrp, category (main/sub), releaseDate, even color are determined by pid, regardless of sizes.`<br/>`- Same pid may have different prices for different sizes.`<br/>`- Around 15% of the 12824 products (which I'll call new products) are released after 2017-10-01.`<br/>`- Zero sales before releaseDate.`<br/>`- All new products were priced one day before releaseDate.`<br/>`- ALL prices lower than rrp. Over 85% of the products have constant prices all the time.`<br/>`- ONLY the new products may have changing prices.`<br/>`- Mostly, the prices of the new products have been increased at least once.`<br/>`- Germany Holiday`[reference](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/germany/2017)<br/>`- A simple way to join the three datasets:`[data-join](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/tree/master/users/XiaodanLyu#data-join)|
