| [abhicc](https://github.com/abhicc) | Need to decide methods/techniques to predict date(and thus our target variable). One way could be waiting time approach. Predict the waiting time before unit(units) sell out. Need to decide how to combine info from all datasets and how to prepare train and test data. Think of ways to include effect of specific dates(days) and effect of 'February' month.  |
| [EugeneHao](https://github.com/EugeneHao) |`- Besides the Black Friday, the price in Jan and Feb,2018 had large change and the change was very frequent. In Feb, the price rose up at the beginning and then dropped a lot on 25th. Probabiliy Winter Olympic and anther festival on 27th Feb had large impact. Around Valentine's Day, price changed little. ` <br/>`- the price had downtrend and got its lowest on 25th Feb and then rose up. `<br/>`(Yuchen Wang's finding)And items in Maincategory 15 had large discount, items in Maincategory 9 had small discount. In mainCateroty 1, items in category 2 had small discount and items in category 7 had large discount.`  |
| [jiamingqiu](https://github.com/jiamingqiu) |`-I think LSTM RNN might work, I put an example code for text generation here.`[TextLSTM_charBychar.R](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/jiamingqiu/TextLSTM_charBychar.R) `-Though I have not tried this with our data, nor can I claim I know what I am doing.` <br/> `-Another interesting stuff: `[forcasting shampoo sale with LSTM network](https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-long-short-term-memory-network-python/)<br/> `-Some comments if trying traditional method: Although I have not tried this, Poisson regression is not necessarily a bad idea, namely treat the number of sales per day per pidXsize as independent random variables, denoted as y(date, pidXsize), and its mean as lambda(date, pidXsize), link our covariates(date), say category, IsHoliday(date), discount(date)... to the mean, say lambda(date, pidXsize) = f(covariates(date, pidXsize)). One problem I can imagine doing this is you will end up tones of 0 response.`<br/>`-Some R code for some neural networks can be found in my user folder. Note that I am not using exactly the same training set.`|

| [lijing28101](https://github.com/lijing28101) |I used time series to predit all 7049 items in training data, and the summary is in [Time Series for 7409 items.docx](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/lijing28101/Time%20Series%20for%207409%20items.docx) |

| [rksyouyou](https://github.com/rksyouyou) | - Size count for each product. More than 40% of products have size count equal to 1. A new variable can be construct based on the size count of a product.<br/> - Some sizes are less informative and could be treated as the same category, e.g. “M(38/40)” and “M(38-42)”. Categories like this could be useful when combining with other features. <br/> - [shoe size web](https://www.healthyfeetstore.com/shoe-length-sizing-charts.html)<br/> - [European sizes](https://www.blitzresults.com/en/european-sizes/). <br/> `- Recode size featrue and provide four new variables related to size, each has 75, 44, 28, 14 categories` [size_codebook.txt](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/rksyouyou/size_clean/size_codebook.txt). An explanation of these variable is saved in [size_codebook.pdf](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/rksyouyou/size_clean/size_codebook.pdf). <br/> - Add [subset function](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/rksyouyou/subset_funs/subset_days_stock.R), a [help document](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/rksyouyou/subset_funs/days_stocks.pdf) and an [example file](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/rksyouyou/subset_funs/example.R). The function could be used to generate a subset of the raw data based on the stock and days (number of days that has units > 0) features.  |
| [ShanYu3393](https://github.com/ShanYu3393) | Notice: there are 7616 (pid size) only having one stock. Negative correlation between daily sale and daily price. |

| [yuchenw2015](https://github.com/yuchenw2015) |-Human learning method seems too simple and too crazy, but it works well and stable. Probably the relation between stock and mean out-of-stock date could be a constrain for other method.<br/>-Dr.Genschel's suggestion (based on her and her family experience):1.The data comes from the company who invests this competition;2.German has Valentine's day but usually they don't buy sports shoes or clothes as a gift;3."The end of winter sale" starts from the end of January, for selling out everything the shop has. Shops need to sell all things they have since the winter to get space for new product.;4.People could buy new shoes anytime, for the nice price, the mode, or any reason.;5.People will prepare for the outdoor activity in Jan and Feb. People really really really love soccer. Also, people loves swimming, but this is the winter data, swimsuit should not be included. 6.This is a data based on Germany market. There are some brands that only Germen buy.|
| [yudizhangzyd](https://github.com/yudizhangzyd) | Maincategory 15 doesn't have subcategory, only category 37 belongs to both maincategory 1 and 9, the rest categories all belong to one maincategory. |

| [XiaodanLyu](https://github.com/XiaodanLyu) |`- We decide to use obs from Oct-Dec as training data and Jan as test data. Only 7409 items sold both before and in January are considered. The stock on 2018-01-01 for each item in the training dataset is chosen by randomly drawing a number from 1 to the sale volumes in Jan with equal probability. We would like to compare different predictors with random guess, in which case all items are predicted to be sold out on the middle day of January, 2018-01-16. Everyone is welcome to try your idea on the split data and show your training error. For the sake of comparison, we had better use the same number of stock on 2018-01-01.`<br/>`- `[split-code](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/XiaodanLyu/data_split.md)<br/>` - `[split-data](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/tree/master/users/XiaodanLyu/data_clean)<br/>`- We are trying to model daily sales and obtain predicted soldOutDates for the split data.`[Leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18DrrDDqp36sUaq_ecZBehLdjNUpEvIGtVxrjoxeVxPo/edit?usp=sharing)|

| [kgulzina](https://github.com/kgulzina) | 1. Color: There are 4 most popular colors: black, blue, red and white. Some luxury brands, have products only of 1-2, maximum 3 colors. <br/> 2. Rare sales: There are 2263 products that were sold only once during 4 months period. Surpisingly, the same number of products, 1 per unique item, were sold during 28 days period i.e in February. So there is a big "wintersale" effect even on rare sales. So we expect the products to be sold by the end of sales.<br/> 3. Sales: Based on the information found in Quora, TripAdvisor and Tmorra, the usual beginning date of the "wintersale" in Germany is the last Monday in January. The ending date is second Saturday in February. These are "old" official dates of wintersales. The official sales season have been abolished a few years ago in Germany. However, many shops stick to the old dates, since customers are used to them.<br/> 4. Holidays: Only one Holiday in Ferbruary is Fasching. It is a large carnival, so I think it has nothing to do with sports. Chtistmas sales are unknown in Germany.<br/> 5. Sports: Germany is a current world champion in soccer. There are plenty of teams participating in Premier and Champions Leagues in soccer throughout the whole year. So, there is no need of special event to germans to buy a sport goods.<br/> 6. Dataset on sales/of any shop in Germany: Whether beacuse Data Science is not so wide spread in Europe yet, or they really keep data confidential, I could not find any reliable, "normal" source for dataset. They are irrelevant at all or they ask $$$. |
