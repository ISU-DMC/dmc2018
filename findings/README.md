| [abhicc](https://github.com/abhicc) | Need to decide methods/techniques to predict date(and thus our target variable). One way could be waiting time approach. Predict the waiting time before unit(units) sell out. Need to decide how to combine info from all datasets and how to prepare train and test data. Think of ways to include effect of specific dates(days) and effect of 'February' month.  |
| [EugeneHao](https://github.com/EugeneHao) |`- Besides the Black Friday, the price in Jan and Feb,2018 had large change and the change was very frequent.

| [rksyouyou](https://github.com/rksyouyou) | `- Size count for each product. More than 40% of products have size count equal to 1. A new variable can be construct based on the size count of a product.`<br/> `- Some sizes are less informative and could be treated as the same category, e.g. “M(38/40)” and “M(38-42)”. Categories like this could be useful when combining with other features.` <br/> - [shoe size web](https://www.healthyfeetstore.com/shoe-length-sizing-charts.html)<br/> - [European sizes](https://www.blitzresults.com/en/european-sizes/). |

| [XiaodanLyu](https://github.com/XiaodanLyu) |`- Around 15% of the 12824 products (which I'll call new products) are released after 2017-10-01.`<br/>`- I agree with Yuchen's findings about the intepretation of the categories and subCategories.`[link](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/yuchenw2015/Sub%20Category.pdf)<br/>`- Both of the two brands, Selles and Kempa, have only one stock, a piece of expensive clothes, sold once.`<br/>`- The brand Onitsuka has only one stock, a pair of shoes, sold once.`<br/>`- Reebok only has one piece of clothes in stock, sold nine times; the others are shoes.`<br>`- Most of the clothes and shoes only have one stock; most of the accessories have more than one stock.`[pic](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/XiaodanLyu/README.md#stock-on-feb-1st)<br/>`- In terms of sale volumes, clothes > accessories > shoes; for clothes: main Category 15 > 1 > 9; for shoes: main Category 1 ~= 9, adults > kids.`[pic](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/XiaodanLyu/README.md#sale-volumes)<br/>`- For old products, shoes of mainCategory 1 are seldom on sale, but shoes of mainCategory 9 are; clothes of mainCategory 9 are seldom on sale, but clothes of mainCategory 1 and 15 are.`<br/>`- All the new products have discount everyday. Similar pattern found for some of the homogeneous categories.`[pic](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/XiaodanLyu/README.md#discount)<br/>`- Brand, rrp, category (main/sub), releaseDate, even color are determined by pid, regardless of sizes.`<br/>`- ALL prices lower than rrp. Over 85% of the products have constant prices all the time.`<br/>`- All new products were priced one day before releaseDate.`<br/>`- ONLY the new products may have changing prices, usually increased at least once.`<br/>`- Germany Holiday`[reference](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/germany/2017)<br/>`- A simple way to join the three datasets:`[data-join](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/tree/master/users/XiaodanLyu#data-join)|
