### To me, SAS is preferred to R.
### Data cleaning. The data sets that we currently have are dirty, with missing values and duplications or both. So I guess some preprocessing hsould be done before I get my hands on them.
### However, those datasets are even dirtier than I exexpected.
### As of now, duplication and missing values are (perhaps partly) dealt with, with no data deleted.
### What're remaining is the interpretation of the werid datasets and creating new features.
### Will do it later.
