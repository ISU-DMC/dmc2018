`- A simple way to join the three datasets:`[data-join](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/tree/master/users/XiaodanLyu#data-join)<br/>
`- Around 15% of the 12824 products (which I'll call new products) are released after 2017-10-01.`<br/>`- I agree with Yuchen's findings about the intepretation of the categories and subCategories.`[link](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/yuchenw2015/Sub%20Category.pdf)<br/>`- Most of the clothes and shoes only have one stock; most of the accessories have more than one stock.`[pic](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/XiaodanLyu/README.md#stock-on-feb-1st)<br/>`- In terms of sale volumes, clothes > accessories > shoes; for clothes: main Category 15 > 1 > 9; for shoes: main Category 1 ~= 9, adults > kids.`[pic](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/XiaodanLyu/README.md#sale-volumes)<br/>`- For old products, shoes of mainCategory 1 are seldom on sale, but shoes of mainCategory 9 are; clothes of mainCategory 9 are seldom on sale, but clothes of mainCategory 1 and 15 are.`<br/>`- All the new products have discount everyday. Similar pattern found for some of the homogeneous categories.`[pic](https://github.com/ISU-DMC/dmc2018/blob/master/users/XiaodanLyu/README.md#discount)<br/>`- Brand, rrp, category (main/sub), releaseDate, even color are determined by pid, regardless of sizes.`<br/>`- ALL prices lower than rrp. Over 85% of the products have constant prices all the time.`<br/>`- ONLY the new products may have changing prices, usually increased at least once.`<br/>
